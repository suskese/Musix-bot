## Music discord bot
Lavalink server is required for this bot.

## Features & Bugs
- Probably plays but breaks
- Doesnt work with content rated for kids on youtube
- Broken local file play (WIP)
- Bassboost, Nightcore
- Search so you could select one song of many search requests
- Can stalk spotify (Ultra hard setup, but bot can play current music from your spotify)

## WHY?
IDK, I wanted to make my own discord music bot with wrapper so i could easily control it, probably.
Originaly this bot was AI Chatbot but I decided to split it off. Maybe someday I will write this from scratch.
Probably this entire repo is just a joke, so dont take this bot as a future. I simply wanted to save my legacy code for memories :)
